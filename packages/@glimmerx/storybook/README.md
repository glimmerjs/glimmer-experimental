# Storybook for GlimmerJs

---

Storybook for GlimmerJs is a UI development environment for your GlimmerJS App.
With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

Storybook runs outside of your app.
So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started

### Automatic setup (tbd)

### Manual setup
If you want to set up Storybook manually for your Glimmerjs project, this is the guide for you.

#### Step 1: Add dependencies
##### Add @glimmerx/storybook
Add glimmerx/storybook to your project. To do that, run:
```
yarn add @glimmerx/storybook --save-dev
```

##### Add peer dependencies
If these are not already present in the host glimmer app include @glimmerx/core, @glimmerx/component packages in your dependencies as well.

```
yarn add @glimmerx/core @glimmerx/component
```

#### Step 2: Add an npm script
Then add the following NPM scripts to your package.json in order to start or build the storybook app.

```
{
    "scripts": {
        "storybook": "start-storybook",
        "build-storybook": "build-storybook"
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create the config file
For a basic Storybook configuration, the only thing you need to do is tell Storybook where to find stories.

To do that, create a file at .storybook/config.js with the following content:
```js
import { configure } from '@glimmerx/storybook';

configure(require.context('../src', true, /\.stories\.js$/), module);
```
That will load all the stories underneath your ../src directory that match the pattern *.stories.js. We recommend co-locating your stories with your source files, but you can place them wherever you choose.

#### Step 4: Write your stories
Now create a ../stories/index.js file, and write your first story like this:

```js
import { storiesOf } from '@glimmerx/storybook';
import OtherComponent from './OtherComponent';
import { hbs } from '@glimmerx/component';

storiesOf('Example Stories', module)
.add('OtherComponent', () => hbs`<OtherComponent @count=101/>`)
.add('OtherComponent with render options', () => ({
  componentClass: OtherComponent,
  renderOptions: {
    args: {
      count: 1007
    }
  }
}));
```
Each story is a single state of your component. In the above case, there is a story using the SampleComponent.

#### Finally: Run your Storybook
Now everything is ready. Run your storybook with:
```
yarn run storybook
```
Storybook should start, on a random open port in dev-mode.

Now you can develop your components and write stories and see the changes in Storybook immediately since it uses Webpackâ€™s hot module reloading.

Storybook also comes with a lot of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons/introduction) and a great API to customize as you wish.
You can also build a [static version](https://storybook.js.org/basics/exporting-storybook) of your storybook and deploy it anywhere you want.
